# StoS - Struct to Struct Mapper Generator

Stos is a Go-based tool that automatically generates mappers to convert one struct to another. The main idea is to define an interface, and the tool will automatically implement the mapping logic.

## Features

- Automatically generates a mapper between structs based on defined interfaces.
- Simplifies struct-to-struct mapping with minimal configuration.

## How to Use

Refer to the `how_to_use.go` file for a detailed example on how to implement the mapper.

## Development Plans
- Refactoring for Efficiency
- Error Handling
- Support for More Data Types
  - *[]Struct to []Struct and vice versa
- Testing
- Code Documentation:
